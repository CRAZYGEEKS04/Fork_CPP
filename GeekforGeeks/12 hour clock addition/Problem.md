Given two positive integers num1 and num2, the task is to find the sum of the two numbers on a 12 hour clock 
rather than a number line.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = 5, num2 = 7

Output: 0

Explaination: 5+7=12, which in 12 hour clock format is 0.

Example 2:

Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5

Output: 8

Explaination: 3+5=8, which is 12 hour format is intact.

Given a number n, a position p and a binary value b, we need to change the bit at position p in n to value b.

Examples : 

```
Input : n = 7, p = 2, b = 0
Output : 3
7 is 00000111 after clearing bit at 
2rd position, it becomes 0000011.

Input : n = 7, p = 3, b = 1
Output : 15
7 is 00000111 after setting bit at 
3rd position it becomes 00001111.
```

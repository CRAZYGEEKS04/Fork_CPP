# *Task*
### Given an integer, *_n_* , perform the following conditional actions:
1. If _n_  is positive and even , print all positive even numbers from 2 to n .
2. If _n_  is positive and odd , print all positive even numbers from 2 to n-1 .
3. If _n_ is negative and even , print  all negative even numbers from -n to -2 .
4. If _n_ is negative and odd , print  all negative even numbers from -n+1 to -2 .

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer,_n_ .

## Output Format
If _n_  is positive and even , print all positive even numbers from 2 to n .
If _n_  is positive and odd , print all positive even numbers from 2 to n-1 .

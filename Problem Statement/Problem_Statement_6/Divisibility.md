# *Definition of Divisibility*
divisibility refers to a number's quality of being evenly divided by another number, without a remainder left over.

# *Task*
### Given two integer, *_n1_* and *_n2_*, perform the following conditional actions:
1. If _n1_  and _n2_ are positive and the max is divisbile the min number , print 'max' is divisible by 'min'
2. If _n1_  and _n2_ are positive and the max is  not divisbile the min number ,  print 'max ' is not divisble by 'min'
3. If either _n1_  and _n2_ are negative , print invalid input


## Input Format
A single line containing two positive integers , _n1_  and _n2_.

## Output Format
print **'max' is divisible by 'min'** if both are positive and the max is divisbile the min number ,  print **'max ' is not divisble by 'min'** , if both are 
positive and the max is divisbile the min number , if either are negative , print **invalid input**

#### *Sample Input 1* 
>- 2  6
#### *Sample Output 1*
>- 6 is divisible by 2



#### *Sample Input 2*
>- 14  3
#### *Sample Output 2*
>- 14 is not divisble by 3


#### *Sample Input 3*
>- -33  4
#### *Sample Output 3*
>- invalid input


## Constraints
>- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000

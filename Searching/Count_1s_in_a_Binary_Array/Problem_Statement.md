### Problem Statement

##### Given a binary array and we have to count the number of 1s in that array.


##### Sample Input and Output

```
I/P:- arr[]={0,0,0,1,1,1,1}

O/P:- 4
```

```
I/P:- arr[]={1,1,1,1,1}

O/P:- 5
```

```
I/P:- arr[]={0,0,0,0}

O/P:- 0
```

**Note:- Binary search is always a good hint to solve a problem when your input array is sorted.**

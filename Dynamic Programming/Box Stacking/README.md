#### We are given an array of boxes. Each boxes is represented using 3 integers denoting height, width, depth of the box. Our goal is stack up the boxes and maximise the total height of the stack.
#### you can't rotate any box i.e. integers in each box must represent [width,depth,height] at all times.
#### A box must have strictly smaller width, depth, and height than any other box below it.

### Problem Statement

#### There is a collection of N wines placed linearly on shelf, the price of the ith wine is pi.
#### Since wines get better every year, suppose today is the year 1, on the year y the price of the ith wine by y * pi i.e. y-times the value that current year.

#### You want to sell all the wines you have, but you want to sell exactly one wine per year, starting this year. On more constraint on each year you call sell either the leftmost or the rightmost wine without re-ordering.
#### Find the maximum profit you can get if you sell all the wines in the optimal order.

```
I/P:- Wines Prices = [2,3,5,1,4]
O/P:- 50
Explanation:- 2*1 + 4*2 + 1*3 + 3*4 + 5*5 = 50

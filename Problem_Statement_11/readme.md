# *Definition of Palindrome*
A palindromic number  is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

# *Task*
### Given an integer, *_n_* , *_t_* , *_n1_* ,  perform the following conditional actions:
For t number of cases 
1. If _n_  is positive and  n1 is positive and even , print an array from 0 to n1 . 
2. If _n_  is positive and  n1 is positive and odd  , print an array from 0 to n1-1 . 
3. If _n_  is positive and  n1 is negative and even , print an array from 0 to n1 . 
4. If _n_  is positive and  n1 is negative and even , print an array from 0 to n1+1 . 
5. If _n_  is negative print invalid number of elements . 

## Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer,_t_ for the number of test cases .
A single line containing a positive integer,_n_ for the number of elements of the series to be printed out .
A single line containing a positive integer,_n1_ for the number the array starts from .

## Output Format
Print the arrays of n elements for t number of cases
